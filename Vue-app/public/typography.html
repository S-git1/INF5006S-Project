					well as for each of the proxy indices. Risk-free rates of return are computed from the JSE’s nominal swap
					yield curve, by rolling an overnight investment over the respective return period. If, however, a share has
					not been traded at a respective month-end, the aforementioned returns are computed between last and
					previous trade dates - this is the thin trading adjustment. If one were to plot these points with the index’s
					returns on the horizontal axis and the share’s returns on the vertical axis (as shown below), beta would
					be the slope of the line that best fits these points. This is illustrated in the figure below (need to insert

					has shown that the trade-off between the desire to include more data points and concerns about
					the stationarity of beta point to five years of data as being most reasonable. It should also be noted that
					using daily or even weekly prices to maximise the number of data points is futile as it introduces considerable
					noise (error) that can introduce significantly biased estimates.<br>
					In the beta tables, some of the more recently listed companies have less than 60 data points that were
					used in the estimation procedure. It is advisable that the betas of these companies are used with caution,
					especially if there are less than about 40 data points indicated in the column headed ‘# Points’.</p>

					calculated on a monthly basis, and then annualised. Hence, a standard deviation of 48.5% should be
					interpreted as 48.5% per annum. To convert this into monthly terms, simply divide the published figure
					by the square root of 12, i.e. (48.5%)/√12 = 14% per month.</p>
